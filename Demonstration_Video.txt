The video shows a few features of Snakey:
0:01
Using Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path to food until it reaches a certain length. This length is based on how large the grid is.

0:05
Then Snakey starts executing the cluster functions. Cluster functions ignore the location of the food and create a back and forth motion so cluster Snakey's body.

0:26
At this point in this recording, Snakey has blocked its path to the next piece of food, so Dijikstra's algorithm ran and returned False. Then snakey is instructed to move in a free direction, and run the algorithm again in hopes of a path emerging, which is what happens at time specified.
